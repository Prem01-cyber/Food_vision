# Food Vision Project

Welcome to the Food Vision project! This computer vision application is designed to automatically recognize and classify various types of foods from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced computer vision techniques.

## Overview

The Food Vision project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify food items into predefined categories. It can distinguish between a wide range of food categories, making it a versatile tool for various applications.

## Dataset: Food Vision 101

- **Dataset Description:** The project is based on the "Food Vision 101" dataset, a comprehensive collection of labeled food images. This dataset covers a diverse range of cuisines, dishes, and food categories, making it suitable for training and evaluating our model's performance.

- **Data Split:** We have divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

## Achievements

- **Accuracy:** Food Vision 1.0 achieved can reach an impressive accuracy of 0.75 on the "Food Vision 101" dataset, surpassing the research baseline accuracy of 0.50.

## Key Features

- Food Classification: Our model excels at classifying food items into predefined categories.

- Fine-Grained Recognition: We are exploring the possibility of fine-grained recognition to identify specific dishes within categories.

- Multi-Label Classification: The system is designed to handle multi-label classification for recipes with multiple ingredients.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `https://github.com/Prem01-cyber/Food_vision.git`

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand our model's development and evaluation process.

## Future Enhancements

We have ambitious plans for the Food Vision project's future:

- Portion Size Estimation: Estimating portion sizes from images to provide nutritional information.

- Recipe Suggestions: Recommending recipes based on recognized food items.

- Allergen Detection: Detecting allergens in food images to assist users with dietary restrictions.
